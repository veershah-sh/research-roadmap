# Research Foundations Framework

A structured, standards-driven framework for **professional research problem identification**, literature analysis, and problem statement formulation.

This repository enforces **research discipline** and eliminates common academic and industry research failures such as vague topics, weak literature reviews, and unjustified assumptions.

---

## Index
1. [Problem Statement Analysis](https://github.com/veershah-sh/research-roadmap/blob/main/1_problem_statement_analysis.md)

---

## Why This Repository Exists
Most research projects fail **before implementation** due to:
- Poorly defined problems
- Superficial paper reading
- No limitation-to-problem mapping
- Hidden assumptions
- Trend-driven topic selection

This repository exists to **prevent those failures at the root**.

---

## Who This Is For
This framework is designed for:
- Universities and colleges
- Research labs and incubation centers
- Internship and training programs
- Early-stage researchers and PhD scholars
- Industry teams doing applied R&D

> ⚠️ This is **not a tutorial repository**. Users are expected to read, analyze, and justify decisions with evidence.

---

## What This Repository Covers (Current Scope)

- Domain, field, and topic selection
- Structured literature review methodology
- Research paper comparison matrix
- Limitation identification and prioritization
- Research problem statement formulation
- Assumptions documentation
- Data source justification
- Future scope definition

---

## How to Use This Repository

1. Start with **[Lecture-1_Problem_Statement_With_Index.md](https://github.com/veershah-sh/research-roadmap/blob/main/1_problem_statement_analysis.md)**
2. Fill every section — skipping is not allowed
3. Base all claims on reviewed literature
4. Get the document reviewed before implementation
5. Use this document as a reference for all future research phases

---

## Research Rules (Non-Negotiable)

- No generic problem statements
- No buzzword-driven topics
- No missing assumptions
- No implementation without problem validation
- No conclusions without evidence

Violation of these rules results in **research rejection**.

---

## Standards Alignment

This framework aligns with expectations from:
- IEEE reviewers
- Springer / Elsevier journals
- Institutional research boards
- Industry R&D review committees

---

## Contribution Guidelines

Contributions must:
- Improve rigor, clarity, or enforceability
- Be evidence-backed
- Follow formal research language

Low-effort, opinion-based, or motivational content will be rejected.
