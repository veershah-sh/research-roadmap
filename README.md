# Research Roadmap
A complete research roadmap.

# Lecture 1: Research Problem Identification & Problem Statement Documentation

## Objective
The objective of this lecture is to train students to **systematically identify a research problem** by analyzing existing research work, identifying limitations, and converting those limitations into a **clear, researchable problem statement**.

This step lays the **foundation of the entire research**, and any mistake here will propagate throughout the project.

## 1. Domain, Field, and Topic Selection

### 1.1 Domain Selection
**Domain** refers to the broad area of research.

**Examples:**
- Artificial Intelligence
- Cybersecurity
- Healthcare Informatics
- Financial Technology
- Smart Cities

> ❗ A domain must be broad enough to contain multiple research problems but specific enough to be meaningful.

**Selected Domain:**  
`<Enter Domain Name>`

---

### 1.2 Field Selection
**Field** is a specialized sub-area within the selected domain.

**Examples (AI Domain):**
- Machine Learning
- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Vision
- Reinforcement Learning

**Selected Field:**  
`<Enter Field Name>`

---

### 1.3 Topic Selection
A **topic** is a focused research area within a field.

**Examples (Field: Machine Learning):**
- Phishing URL Detection
- Fake News Classification
- Crop Disease Detection
- Credit Risk Assessment

**Selected Topic:**  
`<Enter Topic Name>`

> ⚠️ Topic selection should be driven by **research gaps**, not trends or buzzwords.

---

## 2. Research Paper Study

A minimum of **5–6 recent research papers (last 5 years)** must be studied to understand:
- Existing solutions
- Methods used
- Datasets
- Limitations

---

## 3. Literature Review Summary Table

| Sr No | Paper Title | Problem Solved | Method Used | Dataset Used | Limitations |
|------|------------|---------------|-------------|---------------|--------------|
| 1 | Paper-1 Title | Description | Algorithm / Model | Dataset Name | Limitation |
| 2 | Paper-2 Title | Description | Algorithm / Model | Dataset Name | Limitation |
| 3 | Paper-3 Title | Description | Algorithm / Model | Dataset Name | Limitation |
| 4 | Paper-4 Title | Description | Algorithm / Model | Dataset Name | Limitation |
| 5 | Paper-5 Title | Description | Algorithm / Model | Dataset Name | Limitation |

> ❗ This table is mandatory. Without it, **problem formulation is invalid**.

## 4. Limitation Analysis

### 4.1 Listing Identified Limitations
From the reviewed papers, common disadvantages and limitations are identified.

**Examples:**
- Poor performance on unseen data
- High false positive rate
- Requires large labeled datasets
- Not suitable for real-time use
- Language or region dependent
- High computational cost

**Identified Limitations:**
1. `<Limitation 1>`
2. `<Limitation 2>`
3. `<Limitation 3>`

---

### 4.2 Selected Limitation
From the listed limitations, **one or two critical limitations** are selected to define the research problem.

**Selected Limitation:**  
`<Clearly mention the limitation you are targeting>`

> ⚠️ Trying to solve multiple unrelated limitations usually results in weak research.

---

## 5. Problem Statement Definition

### 5.1 Research Problem Statement
The problem statement must be:
- Specific
- Measurable
- Based on a real limitation
- Research-oriented (not implementation-only)

**Problem Statement:**  


---

## 6. Future Scope

Future scope defines how the proposed research can be extended.

**Examples:**
- Testing on real-world datasets
- Scaling the solution for large environments
- Integrating additional data sources
- Improving adaptability across domains
- Deploying as a real-time system

**Future Scope:**
- `<Future enhancement 1>`
- `<Future enhancement 2>`

> ❗ Future scope should be realistic and logically derived from the work.

---

## 7. Assumptions

Assumptions explicitly state the conditions under which the research is conducted.

**Examples:**
- Input data is assumed to be correctly labeled
- Data distribution remains stable
- External factors are ignored
- System operates in a controlled environment

**Research Assumptions:**
1. `<Assumption 1>`
2. `<Assumption 2>`
3. `<Assumption 3>`

> ⚠️ Hidden assumptions are a major reason for paper rejection.

---

## 8. Data Source Used

Clearly specify the dataset(s) used in the research.

### 8.1 Dataset Details
- **Dataset Name:** `<Name>`
- **Source:** `<Kaggle / UCI / GitHub / Organization>`
- **Type:** `<Structured / Unstructured>`
- **Size:** `<Number of records>`
- **Access Type:** `<Public / Private>`

### 8.2 Justification of Dataset
Explain **why this dataset is suitable** for the research problem.
